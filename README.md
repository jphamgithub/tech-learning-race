# Tech Learning Race

Welcome to the **Tech Learning Race**! This repository is designed for anyone to join and share their tech learning journey. Every month, participants push a lightweight submission showcasing something new they've learnedâ€”whether itâ€™s trying a new API, writing a small script, or experimenting with a tool.

## ðŸ“… How to Submit
1. Navigate to the correct month in the `monthly_submissions` folder.
2. Copy the folder template, rename, upload your stuff, and chase glory!
3. Fill out the template and add any code or notes.
4. Submit your work before the end of the month.

Happy learning and coding! ðŸš€
